# <u> Description</u>

In this project, I aim to provide an easy-to-use (this is currently very much not the case) Python library for exploring the crazy world of Cellular Automata. Probably like many of you, I was introduced to the concept via captivating YouTube videos, and I found myself wanting to experiment with different combinations and rules myself. Thus, this library!

# <u>Version History</u>

This section will provide documentation of whatever I deem to be a significant enough change to make it into the README :D
